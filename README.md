GameVault

A simple game discovery website. The user types a query, and I use AI to interpret that query and list relevant games. The project uses the RAWG API in the background, and short AI-generated summaries are added for some game info.

This is my first fully finished project, so it’s not perfect, but I did my best and learned a lot while building it.

FEATURES:

Game search (AI-assisted title analysis)

Game images, release dates, genres, and other basic details

Short game descriptions using GameSummaryService

Simple and clean UI

Removed old and unused features

Better performance and lower API cost

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

C# / .NET 9

ASP.NET Core MVC

Entity Framework Core

RAWG Video Games API

OpenAI API (short descriptions + title analysis)

IMemoryCache

Bootstrap (frontend)

NOTES:

This project was created for learning purposes.

Some parts of the code may be improved later.

I plan to add a few small enhancements (nothing huge).

FUTURE PLANS:

Better filtering options

A basic admin panel

Small UI improvements

Rate limiting / search cooldown
